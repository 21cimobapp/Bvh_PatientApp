Introduction

Telemedicine involves the use of electronic communications to enable health care providers at
different locations to share individual patient medical information for the purpose of improving
patient care. Providers may include primary care practitioners, specialists, and/or subspecialists.
The information may be used for diagnosis, therapy, follow-up and/or education, and may include
any of the following:
· Patient medical records
· Medical images

Electronic systems used will incorporate network and software security protocols to protect the
confidentiality of patient identification and imaging data and will include measures to safeguard
the data and to ensure its integrity against intentional or unintentional corruption.


Possible Risks:

As with any medical procedure, there are potential risks associated with the use of telemedicine.
These risks include, but may not be limited to:

· In rare cases, information transmitted may not be sufficient (e.g. poor resolution of images) to
allow for appropriate medical decision making by the physician and consultant(s);

· Delays in medical evaluation and treatment could occur due to deficiencies or failures of the
equipment;

· In very rare instances, security protocols could fail, causing a breach of privacy of personal
medical information;

· In rare cases, a lack of access to complete medical records may result in adverse drug
interactions or allergic reactions or other judgment errors;


I have read and understand the information provided above regarding telemedicine, have discussed it with my physician or such assistants as may be designated, and all of my questions have been answered to my satisfaction. I hereby give my informed consent for the use of telemedicine in my medical care.
